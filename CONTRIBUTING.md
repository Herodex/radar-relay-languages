2. Create a new branch for your translation work e.g. `es`.
3. Copy `languages/en.js` to your target language file e.g. `languages/es.js`
4. Translate all the strings.
5. Commit your changes
6. Create a pull request which includes the following information:
 * Language full name
 * Language code
 * Your language proficiency: e.g. _Native_, _Business Level_, or _Conversational_.
